# Humanity of Ruby

Ruby code is highly readable and flexible, Ruby community is highly open and helpful: these are the facts most Ruby developers agree and sometimes take for granted. When I just joined Groupon and was challenged to gain both domain and technical knowledge at fast pace, Ruby allowed me to quickly learn what is essential for company's business and contribute to its long-term growth.

"No man is an island". As a Ruby developer, I entered the Ruby community but soon the community entered me. I was inspired by the openness of the community and teamed up with other Groupon engineers attempting to improve Chicago Public Schools. As inequality gap increases in our society, how can we inspire and teach the unpriviledged, and provide them the tools to change their own future?

In this talk, I'll share:
  - My development experience at Groupon: how Ruby helps me understand domain logic quickly and why it is important.
  - My teaching experience at Chicago Public School: how my co-workers and I try to inspire middle school students using technology to unlock their potential.
