# Session Tittle
Embrace Language War

## Target Audience
Experienced Rubyists

## Abstract
Key questions to address
----------------------------
Modern computer languages are double edged sword. Each langauge has its own good and bad things.
What are some good things and bad things for Ruby, and Clojure?

Under the Context of
-----------------------------
  Groupon has manifested itself from a startup to enterprisy company for the past few years.
  Ruby and Rails are great for pivoting start ups, but having a monolithic application is impossible for a company at scale.
    - What do I mean by scale? (Show some Groupon statistics)
    - Groupon initiated I-tier project to swtich from a monolithic application
    - What was the company's service diagram before, and what is the diagram now?

Discussion of Language War
-----------------------------
  Why Ruby is great?
    1. Ruby is great for developing services
      - Readability
      - Mature TDD cycle
    2. Ruby is a great language
      - Metaprogramming (show code that proves meta programming)

  Why Ruby is bad?
    1. Too flexible
      - Easy to allow invalid input to flow into the system
      - Monkey patch encourages bad development habits
      - Overuse of metaprogramming makes it harder to debug

  Why Clojure is great?
    1. Think of services as a collection of function units
      - Show example of message consumption of the message bus
    2. Macros

  Why Clojure is bad?
    1. TBA..

## Notes for Organizers
I've been given talks at user groups and lightning talks at conferences, now I would like to give a full-fledge talk at conferences.
I really hope to share my technical experience @ Groupon and my humble thoughts on different technical subjects I've worked on in the past.
